## 1. player.py

This file defines three classes representing players in a Tic Tac Toe game:

* `Player`: The base class for all players. It has an attribute `letter` to represent the player's symbol (`X` or `O`).
* `HumanPlayer`: A player that takes input from the user via the console.
* `RandomComputerPlayer`: A player that makes random moves.
* `SmartComputerPlayer`: A player that uses the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.

**Key methods:**

* `get_move(self, game)`: This method is responsible for returning the player's next move. Each subclass implements this method differently.

## 2. game.py

This file defines the `TicTacToe` class which represents the game itself.

**Key methods:**

* `__init__(self)`: Initializes the game with an empty board and no winner.
* `print_board(self)`: Prints the current state of the game board.
* `print_board_nums(self)`: Prints the board with numbers representing each square for easier reference.
* `available_moves(self)`: Returns a list of available squares on the board.
* `empty_squares(self)`: Checks if there are any empty squares left on the board.
* `make_move(self, square, letter)`: Makes a move on the board for the given player.
* `winner(self, square, letter)`: Checks if the last move resulted in a win for the given player.

**Additional functions:**

* `play(game, x_player, o_player, print_game=True)`: Starts a game of Tic Tac Toe with the provided players and optional printing of the board state.

**Note:** This is a basic overview of the code. For a deeper understanding, it is recommended to read and analyze the code yourself.

## Additional Notes

* This code uses the `minimax` algorithm in the `SmartComputerPlayer` class for making strategic moves.
* **Minimax algorithm:**
    * A decision-making algorithm used to find the best move in two-player zero-sum games like Tic Tac Toe.
    * It simulates all possible future game states and chooses the move that leads to the best outcome for the player (maximizing their score and minimizing the opponent's).
    * It uses recursion to explore the entire game tree, evaluating each possible future state based on a scoring function.
    * In this code, the scoring function considers factors like the number of squares each player controls and the potential for immediate wins or blocks.
* The code includes comments to explain the purpose of different methods and classes.
* You can adjust the `print_game` argument in the `play` function to control whether the game board is printed during the game.
