# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- **Player Classes**: Two player classes are implemented - `HumanPlayer` for human players and `RandomComputerPlayer` for computer players making random moves.
- **Game Logic**: The `TicTacToe` class handles the game logic, including checking for a winner, making moves, and printing the game board.
- **Game Playback**: The `play` function orchestrates the game by alternating player turns until the game is won or ends in a tie.

## How to Play

1. Run the `player.py` file to initialize the player classes.
2. Run the `game.py` file to start a game of Tic Tac Toe.
3. Enter moves according to the prompt (for HumanPlayer) or watch the computer make random moves (for RandomComputerPlayer).
4. The game will continue until a player wins or the board is full (resulting in a tie).

## File Structure

- `player.py`: Contains the `Player`, `RandomComputerPlayer`, and `HumanPlayer` classes for defining players.
- `game.py`: Contains the `TicTacToe` class and the `play` function for executing the game.

## Customization

- **Player Types**: You can create custom player classes by inheriting from the `Player` class and implementing the `get_move` method.
- **Game Delay**: Adjust the time delay between moves by modifying the sleep duration in the `play` function.
